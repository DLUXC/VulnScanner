## VulnScanner
# Overview
VulnScanner is a Python script designed to scan and detect vulnerabilities in a given target system. It leverages various techniques to identify security issues, misconfigurations, and other potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. This script can be used for security audits and penetration testing to ensure the security of web applications and networks.

This repository provides the Scanner.py script, which can be customized to scan specific vulnerabilities in the target system.
